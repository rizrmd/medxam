# Milestone 6: Attempt/Scoring System Implementation

**Date**: August 12, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Completed

## Overview
Implemented the complete attempt and scoring system for the MedXam backend, enabling exam attempt management, answer tracking, and results generation.

## Features Implemented

### Attempt Management
- **Start Attempt**: POST `/api/attempts/start` - Create new exam attempts for deliveries
- **List Attempts**: GET `/api/attempts` - Paginated list with filtering by taker, delivery, exam, and completion status
- **Get Attempt**: GET `/api/attempts/{id}` - Basic attempt details
- **Get Attempt Details**: GET `/api/attempts/{id}/details` - Complete attempt with taker, exam, and delivery info
- **Finish Attempt**: POST `/api/attempts/{id}/finish` - Mark attempts as completed

### Answer Management
- **Save Answer**: POST `/api/attempts/{id}/answer` - Save/update answers to questions
- **Get Answers**: GET `/api/attempts/{id}/answers` - Retrieve all answers for an attempt
- Answer tracking with timestamps and time spent per question

### Scoring System
- **Update Score**: PUT `/api/attempts/{id}/score` - Admin-only score and penalty updates
- **Results Summary**: GET `/api/deliveries/{deliveryId}/results` - Comprehensive results for delivery
- Automatic scoring support with manual override capabilities

## Database Operations
- **Attempt Repository**: Complete CRUD operations with raw SQL queries
- **Answer Management**: Upsert operations for attempt_questions table
- **Result Analytics**: Complex queries for result summaries with statistics

## Models and Types
```go
- Attempt: Core attempt tracking
- AttemptQuestion: Individual question answers
- AttemptWithDetails: Full attempt data with relations
- ResultSummary: Comprehensive result statistics
- AttemptSearchRequest: Filtering parameters
```

## API Endpoints Summary
1. `GET /api/attempts` - List attempts (paginated, filtered)
2. `GET /api/attempts/{id}` - Get attempt by ID
3. `GET /api/attempts/{id}/details` - Get attempt with full details
4. `POST /api/attempts/start` - Start new attempt
5. `POST /api/attempts/{id}/finish` - Finish attempt
6. `POST /api/attempts/{id}/answer` - Save answer
7. `GET /api/attempts/{id}/answers` - Get attempt answers
8. `PUT /api/attempts/{id}/score` - Update score (admin only)
9. `GET /api/deliveries/{deliveryId}/results` - Get results summary

## Security & Authorization
- All endpoints require authentication
- Score updates restricted to administrators
- Session-based access control maintained
- User context preserved in attempt creation

## Database Schema Integration
- Seamless integration with existing `attempts` and `attempt_questions` tables
- Foreign key relationships with takers, exams, deliveries maintained
- Proper indexing support for performance

## Testing Results
- ✅ Application builds successfully
- ✅ Server starts without errors
- ✅ Database connectivity confirmed
- ✅ Health endpoint responds correctly
- ✅ OpenAPI documentation generated

## Files Created/Modified
- `internal/repository/attempt_repo.go` - New attempt repository with full CRUD
- `internal/handlers/attempt.go` - New attempt handlers for all endpoints
- `internal/models/attempt.go` - Updated with search request model
- `cmd/api/main.go` - Added attempt repository and handler registration

## Next Steps
All major backend functionality has been completed. The system now supports:
- Complete user and session management
- Group and candidate management
- Exam and question set management
- Delivery scheduling and management
- Attempt tracking and scoring
- Results generation and analytics

The MedXam backend is now feature-complete with all 24 originally specified features implemented.
